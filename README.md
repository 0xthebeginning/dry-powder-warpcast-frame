# dry-powder-warpcast-frame

The unique FID of the warpcast user that interacts with the frame gets passed through to query all of their EVM connected wallets. This frame uses the Zapper API to get all the token balances across all the networks Zapper supports. So the frame ends up displaying the total USD value the user has to deploy to what come next.(purposely does not include NFTs/Position balances, only easily accessible token to swap).
